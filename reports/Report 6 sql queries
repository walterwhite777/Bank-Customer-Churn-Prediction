# Bank Customer Churn Prediction â€“ Enhancements

This repository contains enhancements to the original **Bank Customer Churn Prediction** project.  
I added SQL integration, exploratory data analysis, and advanced queries to make the project more useful for **business-driven insights**.

## Enhancements Done

### 1. Data Integration
- Created a MySQL database `bank_churn_db` and a `customers` table.  
- Loaded `Customer-Churn-Records.csv` directly into MySQL for reproducibility and easy query execution.  
- Established SQLAlchemy + Pandas connection for seamless querying inside Jupyter notebooks.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed **statistical summaries** and **distribution plots** (age, credit score, balance, churn distribution).  
- Generated churn breakdowns by **gender, geography, and account activity**.  
- Plots added for:
  - Age distribution
  - Credit score distribution
  - Balance distribution
  - Churn rate comparisons across features

### 3. SQL Queries
#### Basic Queries
- Customer counts, churn percentages
- Average balance by geography
- Distribution of products & credit card ownership
- Churn rate by gender & age groups

#### Advanced Queries
- **Window functions**: rank customers by balance within geography  
- **CTEs**: segment churn risk by age & balance  
- **CASE WHEN**: classify customers into churn risk categories  
- **Joins & aggregations** for product-wise churn  
- **Churn probability buckets** for managerial insights  

### 4. Notebook
- Added a new notebook: `notebooks/sql_queries.ipynb`  
- Contains:
  - Database connection setup
  - EDA using SQL + Pandas
  - Basic & advanced SQL queries
  - Visualizations of churn behavior

## How This Helps
- Provides **business insights** beyond pure ML modeling.  
- Makes project portfolio-ready by combining **SQL, analytics, and visualization**.  
- Ensures reproducibility through database-backed workflows.
